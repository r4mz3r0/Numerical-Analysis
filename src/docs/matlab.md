## Chapter 2
### Exercise 2-1 

Find the number of ways of choosing 12 elements from 30 without repetition, the remainder of the division of \(2^{134}\) by 3,
the prime decomposition of 18900, the factorial of 200 and the smalleset number N which when divided by 16,24,30 and 32 leaves remainder 5.

``` js
factorial(30)/(factorial(12)*factorial(30-12))
rem(2^134,3)
factor(18900)
factorial(100)
lcm(lcm(16.24), lcm(30,32))
```
